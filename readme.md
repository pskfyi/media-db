# Media DB

Query media information APIs and store the retrieved information in local YAML
files.

A work in progress and weekend project.

## Example

You'll need an API key from [themoviedb.org](themoviedb.org). It's free.

With Deno installed, clone the repo and `cd` into it. Edit `example.ts` to add
your API key, then run the file:

```ts
deno run -A --watch example.ts
```
